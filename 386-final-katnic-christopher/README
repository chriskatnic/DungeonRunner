CPSC 386, Term Project

Introduction: Dungeon Runner is a simple dungeon crawler built around the pygame 
module. The purpose of this project was to create a nontrivial game from the 
ground up that implemented lessons learned in class. In addition, this project
provided an excellent prompt to implement software design principles taught
in CPSC 462, which I challenged myself to do.

Preconditions: In addition to the standard python installation, the software 
requires that the pygame module has been downloaded. It can be acquired from 
http://www.pygame.org/

Installation: Unzip the game into any directory. Then, open a command prompt
window inside the DungeonRunner directory, and enter the following command:

python creategame.py

Rules: The player may move using the WASD keys along the corridor generated
every time a new floor loads. In battle, the player may only use the 'a' and
'h' keys to attack and heal, and must remain in battle until a character dies.
The player may not return to a previous floor visited, only further down.
Every battle shall begin with the player's turn, and alternate between the
player and the enemy. The player may attack or heal, and the enemy will always attack
If the player wins, they will level up, and receive a bonus heal.
If the player loses, the game will show the gameover splash screen, and exit.

Features and Bugs: Currently there are no additional features, and no known bugs.
